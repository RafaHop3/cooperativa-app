# Advanced Security Features for Activity Logging System

## Feature Description
[Brief description of the security feature being implemented]

## Requirements

### 1. Digital Signatures on Sensitive Logs
- [ ] Implement cryptographic signatures (HMAC or RSA) for log entries
- [ ] Create key management system for storing and retrieving signing keys
- [ ] Add signature verification on log retrieval
- [ ] Handle key rotation and signature validation across key changes
- [ ] Add configuration to determine which log types require signatures
- [ ] Implement signature verification endpoint for external validation

### 2. Reversible Auditing System
- [ ] Create `meta_logs` table to track access to the logging system
- [ ] Record user ID, timestamp, and action for each log access
- [ ] Store query parameters used for log retrieval
- [ ] Generate cryptographic hash of each query for validation
- [ ] Implement meta-log viewer with appropriate access controls
- Ensure meta-logs cannot be modified (append-only)

### 3. Secure Export with Verification
- [ ] Implement log export functionality in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Generate cryptographic hash of exported data
- [ ] Include verification hash in export metadata/footer
- [ ] Create verification tool to validate exported log integrity
- [ ] Add digital signature to exports (using admin private key)
- [ ] Document verification process for exported logs

### 4. Post-Audit Read-Only Mode
- [ ] Add `locked` status field to activity logs
- [ ] Create `log_locks` table to track when and by whom logs were locked
- [ ] Implement time-based or event-based automatic locking
- [ ] Add manual locking capability for administrators
- [ ] Prevent modifications to locked logs at database level
- [ ] Create admin override capability for exceptional circumstances (with audit trail)

## Technical Considerations
- Performance impact of cryptographic operations
- Key management security
- Backup and restore procedures for keys
- Database schema changes and migration plan
- API changes and backward compatibility

## Security Review
- [ ] Code review by security team
- [ ] Penetration testing of new features
- [ ] Key management review
- [ ] Compliance assessment (GDPR, HIPAA, etc. as applicable)

## Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create admin guide for new security features
- [ ] Document verification procedures for exported logs
- [ ] Document key management procedures

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with existing systems
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security testing
